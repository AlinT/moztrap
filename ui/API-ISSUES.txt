* API requires passing plaintext auth info with each request, requiring the UI
  to store plaintext auth info for as long as a user session is active.

* Double-assignment of an included-test-case should raise an error, but
  currently creates a second assignment.

* Permissions-checking uses wrong permissions in some cases (i.e. EDIT rather
  than APPROVE), and may not be sufficiently granular.
