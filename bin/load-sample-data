# Load the sample data fixture.

# Ugh. We have to overwrite permission and content type data so that the IDs
# match up so the default roles have the correct permissions in the sample
# data. But we can't just overwrite the data in loading the fixture, as content
# types have a unique constraint, and MySQL doesn't know how to defer
# constraints until the end of a transaction. So we have to first clear out
# content types, and the other tables with foreign keys to content type.
