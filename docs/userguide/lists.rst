Working with Lists
==================

Much of the navigation in Case Conductor is done with lists. When managing
things like :ref:`Test Cases<test-cases>`, it is possible to have a very long
list of items.


.. _filters:

Filters
-------

You can use filters to narrow down the size of the list you're currently
viewing. You can do simple filtering by either clicking certain fields in the
list (like tags or Product Version), or by typing them in the filter field.

Another option is to click the "Advanced Filtering" button to show your filter
options.  Simply click the item value you would like to use for filtering.  When it
has a check mark next to it, the filter is enabled.

.. Note::

    If you have two filters for items of the same type (such as two Tag
    filters) then the filters are treated as an OR between them, rather than an
    AND. For instance, if you filter on tags "One" and "Two" the list will
    reflect items that have EITHER "One" or "Two", not just ones that have
    both.

.. _details:

Details
-------

Notice there is a triangle on the very left of every list item. Click this
triangle to expand and see details about that list item.
