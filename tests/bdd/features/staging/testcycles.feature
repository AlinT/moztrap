Feature: Test Cycles

    Scenario: Add team member to testrun, it's reflected in the testcycle
        Given I create the seed company and product with these names:
            | company name    | product name  |
            | Massive Dynamic | Cortexiphan   |
        When I create a new user with name "Capn Admin"
        And I activate the user with that name
        And I create a new role with name "Approvationalist" with the following permissions:
            | permissionCode               |
            | PERMISSION_TEST_CASE_EDIT    |
            | PERMISSION_TEST_CASE_APPROVE |
            | PERMISSION_TEST_RUN_ASSIGNMENT_EXECUTE |
        And I add the role with name "Approvationalist" to the user with that name
        When the user with that name creates a new testcase with name "Passing tc"
        And when I add these steps to the testcase with that name:
            | name      | stepNumber | estimatedTimeInMin | instruction    | expectedResult        |
            | Mockery   | 1          | 5                  | Go this way    | They went this way    |
        Then when I create a new user with name "Joe Tester"
        And I activate the user with that name
        And I add the role with name "Approvationalist" to the user with that name
        And when I create the following new testcycles:
            | name          | description               | product name | startDate  | endDate    | communityAuthoringAllowed | communityAccessAllowed |
            | Baroque Cycle | Ahh, the cycle of life... | Cortexiphan  | 2011/02/02 | 2012/02/02 | true                      | true                   |
        And when I create a new testrun with name "Running Man" with testcycle "Baroque Cycle"
        And I add the following users to the testrun with name "Running Man":
            | name       |
            | Joe Tester |
        Then the testcycle with name "Baroque Cycle" has the following team members:
            | name         |
            | Joe Tester |
